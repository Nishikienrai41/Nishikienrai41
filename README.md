## About Me

I am a software developer with a strong interest in programming fundamentals,  
problem-solving, and structured software development.  
I prefer clarity over complexity and focus on writing maintainable, logical code.

I enjoy learning how things work under the hood while also building practical applications.  
My goal is to grow into a disciplined and reliable developer by working on real projects  
and improving my technical depth step by step.
